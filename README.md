## F1 Racing Simulation with OpenCV Integration

### Overview

**F1-Simulation** is an innovative F1 Racing Game that seamlessly integrates real-world steering wheel input through OpenCV tracking techniques. The project implements a unique approach by transmitting the input data to Unity3D via the UDP protocol, offering an immersive and interactive gaming experience.

### Key Features

1. **Unity3D Integration**: The game is developed using Unity3D, providing a visually engaging and realistic F1 racing environment.

2. **OpenCV Steering Input**: Utilizing OpenCV tracking techniques, the project enables users to simulate steering wheel controls by incorporating real-world objects. This innovative approach enhances user interaction and gameplay.

3. **UDP Protocol Communication**: The input data from the OpenCV tracking is transmitted to Unity3D seamlessly using the UDP protocol. This ensures a smooth and responsive connection between the real-world steering input and the in-game simulation.

4. **Flexible Steering Control**: Users can simulate a steering wheel controller by attaching printable trackers to any object, allowing for a customizable and flexible gaming experience.

### Usage Instructions

1. **Install the Game using Unity**:
   - Clone the repository or download the Unity project from the provided [Game Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1bvCmqL11zI31Fy8ouCAtefo56c9AAvh0).

2. **Create a Controller with Green Circles for Controls**:
   - Design and set up a controller with green circles to serve as the interactive controls for steering within the game.

3. **Run the main-steering.py File**:
   - Execute the `main-steering.py` file to initiate the OpenCV tracking for steering input.

4. **Steering Setup**
   - Attach trackers to the object to be used as a steering wheel.
     
5. **Enjoy the Game**:
   - Immerse yourself in the F1 racing simulation and experience the thrill of controlling the vehicle through real-world steering input.
